# ChurnAnalysis
Customer Churn Analysis experiments are employed using Classical ML (Machine Learning) algorithms and Deep Neural Network (DNN). A dataset from telecom is used for experimental studies.

1. Dataset is created in telecom domain.

2. Classical Machine Learning Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree (CART)
- K-NN
- SVM
- LDA
- AdaBoostClassifier
- BaggingClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier

3. Deep Neural Network model is constructed based on Keras.
